This website is mainly constructed with four parts; they are the rack/tiles,
board, drag and drop, and score. On the start of the game, the rack and tiles are
shown with the tiles partly covering the rack. This is implemented by modifying
the style positions with css. The board is just a unordered list constructed
with three different type of blocks which are class named normal, doubleLetter,
and doubleWord; these are just background color with text instead of images. The
drag and drop uses a jquery ui to name who(tiles) can be dragged,
where(board_tile) can be dropped, and what will happen if dropped. When a tile
is dropped onto a board_tile, the tile will be removed and a html with an
identical tile will replace the corresponding board_tile html. The elements on the
board will be used to make a corresponding string. This string will be used to
calculate the score. When the newGame button is clicked, the score will be
inserted into an array that consists of all the previous scores, if any.
